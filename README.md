# KiCad-MCB3201
KiCad Component of the Microchip "MCP3201" 2.7 V 12 Bit A/D Converter with SPI

This is a component I needed for a university project. Because I did not find it for KiCad on the web, I had to create it.
I am releasing it here so that other people don't need to create it theirselves.

The footprint for this component in KiCad is called `Housings_DIP:DIP-8_W7.62mm`.
